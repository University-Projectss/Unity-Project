# About
The player controls a plane in 3rd person view. The plane has the following functionalities: free flight and shooting. The plane can crash and explode if it comes into contact with objects too strongly. The plane fires bullets in the direction of movement.

The game takes place in an unbounded arena (if everything goes well) and the action will be endless wave based. Each wave will increase in difficulty and the waves will contain various challenges:

- the main type of wave is survival/elimination, in which various enemies will spawn in the arena (other planes, maybe also ground troops); the main goal will be either the elimination of all enemies or survival for a period of time
- there may be other types (TBD), such as flying through obstacles
