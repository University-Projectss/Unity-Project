# About
The game is a third-person flight simulator set in an unbounded 3D arena with procedurally generated natural landscapes. The objective is to survive as long as possible by navigating obstacles and collecting time-extending power-ups. The countdown timer depletes continuously, and the game ends when it reaches zero or when the airplane crashes.
## Game Mechanics
**Time Extension:** Collect glowing spheres to add seconds to the timer.

**Target Shooting:** Shoot bullets into static targets for additional time.
## Aircraft Controls
Acceleration **(Space)** and Deceleration **(Shift)** for variable speed.

Responsive steering for precise maneuverability.

### Roll Control:

* Adjusting the aircraft's lateral inclination.
* **Q** (left wing lift), **E** (right wing lift)
  
### Pitch Control:

* Altering the aircraft's longitudinal attitude.
* **S** (nose up), **W** (nose down)
  
### Yaw Control:

* Rotating the aircraft around its vertical axis.
* **A** (nose left), **D** (nose right)
## Obstacle Avoidance & Scoring System
Navigate through obstacles using responsive controls to avoid collisions.

Score is based on survival duration.
