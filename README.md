# About
The game is a third-person flight simulator set in an unbounded 3D arena with procedurally generated natural landscapes. The objective is to survive as long as possible by navigating obstacles and collecting time-extending power-ups. The countdown timer depletes continuously, and the game ends when it reaches zero or when the airplane crashes.
## Game Mechanics
**Time Extension:** Collect glowing spheres (Checkpoints) to add seconds to the timer. They are surrounded by a glowing ray so that they can be easily seen through the fog. When it initially spawns, the checkpoint is green, but it gradually turns red as time passes. If enough time passes (5-20 seconds) without the checkpoint being collected, it respawns in a new location.

**Dimensions navigation:** After every 10 checkpoints, a portal spawns and takes you to another dimension.

**Bonus Event**: After every 3 portals, you are taken to a bonus event where boxes fall from the sky for 15 seconds. Shoot as many as possible to gain time.

## Aircraft Controls
Acceleration **(Space)** and Deceleration **(Shift)** for variable speed.

Responsive steering for precise maneuverability.

### Roll Control:

* Adjusting the aircraft's lateral inclination.
* **Q** (left wing lift), **E** (right wing lift)
  
### Pitch Control:

* Altering the aircraft's longitudinal attitude.
* **S** (nose up), **W** (nose down)
  
### Yaw Control:

* Rotating the aircraft around its vertical axis.
* **A** (nose left), **D** (nose right)

### Music Control
* Press **CTRL** (works with both left and right CTRL's) to switch to another track from the total of 6.
* **ArrowUp/ArrowDown** (⬆️/⬇️) to adjust the music volume.
## Obstacle Avoidance & Scoring System
Navigate through obstacles using responsive controls to avoid collisions.

Score is based on survival duration.
## Game Modes
### Easy Mode:
Much more permissive than the default game mode, the timer should not trouble the player too much in this game mode. The Easy Mode should be used for training or warming up.
### Casual Mode:
This is the easiest game mode and its purpose is to help the player get used to the controls. There is no timer at all and **you can respawn a checkpoint by pressing the C key**.
